## Overview
Stretty Counter is a basic web app designed to demonstrate how JavaScript can interact with the DOM (Document Object Model) to create a dynamic and interactive user experience. The counter allows users to keep track of increments, and also stores and displays previous count entries.

The background image of the app is of the Stretford Metrolink station, adding a local touch to the application. The app is styled with custom CSS for a sleek, dark theme and is fully responsive, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features
Increment Button: Click the "INCREMENT" button to increase the counter.
Save Button: Click the "SAVE" button to log the current count and reset the counter to zero.
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop use.
Visual Feedback: Button effects and hover transformations enhance user interaction.
